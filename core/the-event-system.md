# The event system

API Platform leverages [events triggered by the Symfony HTTP Kernel](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_kernel/introduction.html#creating-an-event-listener)
to provide a powerful set of convenient hooks at all times of the object lifecycle.

[Doctrine events](http://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/events.html#reference-events-lifecycle-events)
are also available (if you use it).
